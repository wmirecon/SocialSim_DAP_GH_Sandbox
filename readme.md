# ReadMe.MD

Any file that you add to the repository with a .md extension will be displayed when looking at the folder. A readme is the most common
and used to describe the repo or subfolder. It is stored at text and can be formated. The title above is made by putting a single hashtag (#)
at the start of the line and the more hastags used, the lower the headline level.
